# Spectez

### Description - 
Spectez is an extension for your mac's spotlight, it lets you inspect any tezos user address or any smart contract address on both mainnet and ghostnet directly from your desktop, no need for any browsers.


### Problem -
Spectez is aiming to decrease the time taken by browsers to navigate to any indexer and look up any address, it lets you inspect directly from your home screen, no need to switch apps or tabs as spotlight is available everywhere as a hover app. 


### Tech Stack -
This tool is solely built using Typescript
