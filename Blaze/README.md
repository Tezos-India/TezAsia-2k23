# E-Voting Dapp on Tezos Blockchain with face recognition and crowdfunding

## The problem it solves
- It enables secure, transparent and decentralized voting for any kind of election or decision-making process.
- It uses face recognition to verify the identity of voters and prevent double voting or impersonation.
- It allows voters to contribute funds to the candidates or causes they support, creating a direct link between voting and funding.
- It leverages the Tezos blockchain to ensure immutability, scalability and low fees for the voting and crowdfunding transactions.
- It empowers voters to have more control and influence over the outcomes of their collective choices.

## Challenges we ran into
- Developing a secure and scalable smart contract on Tezos using Michelson language
- Integrating face recognition technology with the voting system to ensure voter identity and prevent fraud
- Designing a user-friendly interface for the voters and the candidates to interact with the Dapp
- Implementing a crowdfunding mechanism to allow candidates to raise funds for their campaigns
