      content: `Polyhess is a Chess gameplay website where you can play with your friends. There are 3 modes, Free-to-Play, Token betting, and Nft bets. Free-to-Play as the name suggests does not include any money as sort. While betting needs HT tokens for betting purposes. You and your friend both will stake an equal amount of Hess Tokens and have a game of chess to decide who gets the stake.  NFT staking is the same as token staking but you are playing for NFTs rather than NFTs.`,

      content: `Non-Fungible tokens of NFTs means they are unique and canâ€™t be traded for other NFTs. Like one bitcoin can be exchanged for another bitcoin, NFTs are not like that. Their uniqueness is backed by technology like blockchain and to be honest anything digital can be NFT, picture, mp3 files, books, anything you can imagine. We created NFTs of famous chess players, if you like art, buy it at the marketplace.`,

      title: "Okay! I get it but does these NFTs have any utility?",
      content: `Yes we got you covered in that. You will be able to play with your friends and bet your NFTs on a game of chess but what is ingenious here is whichever NFT you are gonna stake the king of the Board will take the face on NFT, which looks super awesome does it not?.`,

    {
      title: "How many NFTs are there?",
      content: `There are 25 NFTs and each costs 10^10 HT tokens or 0.01 Ethers. They can be used to play in NFT staking or can be used to trade in the marketplace.`,

      title: "How does the leaderboard metrics work?",
      content: `For each win you get 2 points for each loss you get 1 point and for each draw you get 1.5 points. As we want to promote users to play chess more and more rather than their  The more you play the higher your rank is.`,
