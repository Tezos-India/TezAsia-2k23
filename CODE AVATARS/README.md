# Project Name - Dice Game

# Project Description
Build a dice-rolling game. A group of people initially (invite only) will join in, guess a number from the range
[1, 6], and then put a bet upon their guess. The one who guesses the output correctly is treated as the
winner(s). Then the entire pool of bets automatically gets distributed across these winner(s). The main
challenge here is to generate a perfectly random number in the given range (of course on-chain) so as to
avoid any misleads. Once this is achieved, a complete section of games can be further built upon this
random module.

# Problem trying to Solve
The Problem is to develop an interactive dice game . And to provide engaging audio experience while pressing the key buttons Audio API is used for the functionality
 
Randomized set of combinations of dice is achieved through random() function of js which will be the backbone for the project
interactive audio api is used on clicking game button to generate sound and responsive user interface is used for buttons
