# FlexPass: A Blockchain-based Movie Ticket Booking Platform

## Project Overview
FlexPass is a revolutionary movie ticket booking platform built on blockchain technology. It introduces a unique feature of reselling movie tickets and employs a recommendation engine to determine reselling prices based on movie reviews and ratings. The platform aims to provide a seamless and transparent experience for users, theaters, and movie enthusiasts.

## Problem Statement
Traditional movie ticket booking platforms lack transparency in ticket reselling and often lead to inflated prices in secondary markets. FlexPass addresses this issue by leveraging blockchain's transparency and smart contracts to enable fair ticket reselling and ensure that theaters receive their due royalties.

## Key Features
- **Ticket Reselling:** Users can resell their purchased movie tickets on the platform, helping others access sold-out shows and events.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Utilizes movie reviews and ratings to algorithmically suggest fair reselling prices for tickets.
- **Theater Royalties:** Theatres receive a portion of the proceeds from every resold ticket, providing an incentive for their participation.
- **Convenience Fee:** The platform charges users a nominal convenience fee for utilizing its services.
- **Listing Fee:** Theatres pay a listing fee to feature their movies on the FlexPass platform.
- **Revenue Sharing:** FlexPass also earns a share from the theaters' profits generated through the platform.
