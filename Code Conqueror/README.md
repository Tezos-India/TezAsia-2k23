TezAsia Hackathon 3.0 - Team Repository  Welcome to our team's repository for the TezAsia Hackathon 3.0! This repository serves as a centralized hub for our team's project , documentation, code, and collaboration. Here, we will outline the purpose, features, setup instructions, and guidelines for contributing to our project.

not able to conplete these task in hackathon deadline due to some reasons.. -_-

## Here is IDEA and details for this project --

## Team Name - Code Conqueror 
## Project - Gaming Track
# Prokject Description - Bluff Game

### Frontend Development:
Start by creating the frontend of your game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Design the game interface, including the game board, cards, and chat box. Make sure the UI is
user-friendly and responsive.

### Implement the card distribution animation and game animations for smooth user experience.
Backend Development: Set up a backend server to handle game logic, card distribution, player actions, and chat
messages. You can use Node.js or any other backend technology you are comfortable with.

### Online Multiplayer Functionality:
Implement the multiplayer functionality to allow players to join the game and play together.
Use WebSockets or a similar technology for real-time communication between players and the
server. Handle player connections, disconnections, and game synchronization.

### Tezos Blockchain Integration:
To integrate Tezos blockchain, you'll need a Tezos wallet for each player. Players will need to
sign transactions, so consider using a library like Taquito (JavaScript library for Tezos) to
interact with the Tezos blockchain. Define smart contracts that handle the game state, player actions, and verify the validity of moves.Implement the communication between your backend and the Tezos blockchain to update the
game state and manage transactions.

### Chat Functionality:
Develop the chat feature to enable players to communicate with each other during the game.
Implement message broadcasting and display messages in the chat box.

### User Authentication:
Implement a user authentication system to identify players and ensure the security of their
actions.
Consider using OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
