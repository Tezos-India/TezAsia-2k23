<h1>Healthcare Record Management Project</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Healthcare Record Management (HRM) project focuses on providing a secure platform for managing patient and doctor information by leveraging the Tezos blockchain and advanced encryption techniques.</p>

   <h2>Project's Description</h2>
  <p>The Healthcare Record Management (HRM) project aims to provide a platform for the patients, doctors and various healthcare stakeholders where access-controlled data is stored, exchanged and kept as a medical record for a patient. </p>

  <h2>Problem we are trying to solve</h2>
  <p>The HRM project aims to address the challenges of securely managing healthcare data, ensuring patient privacy, and
    enabling efficient communication between patients and doctors. This project also aims to leverage tools like blockchain, decentralized storage and access control mechanisms to reduce redundancy and protect privacy.</p>

  <h2>Tech Stack Used While Building the Project</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes technologies including Tezos blockchain, AES encryption, RSA encryption, IPFS (InterPlanetary File
    System), and TequitoJS and node libraries like chakra and react for the front end.</p>

  <h2>Deployed Smart contract link</h2>
  
  <p>The smart contract address is <code>KT1KKknhpn1iiBqB315okxm7iiscPtpRWgwy</code>
  You can see it on blockchain explorer <code>https://ghostnet.tzkt.io/KT1KKknhpn1iiBqB315okxm7iiscPtpRWgwy/entrypoints</code></p>

  <h2>Additional Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each user is assigned a unique public-private key pair for robust identity and data security.</li>
    <li>Users have the capability to upload their encrypted medical diagnoses onto the blockchain.</li>
    <li>Data sharing is selective, with users maintaining control over whom they share their information with.</li>
    <li>Secure key exchange mechanisms ensure that the AES key used for encryption remains confidential.</li>
    <li>Recipient doctors can access shared data by decrypting the encrypted AES key.</li>
    <li>Recipient doctors can also contribute by uploading encrypted document URLs.</li>
    <li>Users have full authority to retract shared information, offering complete data control.</li>
  </ul>

      <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/temple-tezos-wallet/ookjlbkiijinhpmnjffcofjonbfbgaoc"
        target="_blank">here</a> and make a new wallet.</li>
    <li>Obtain funds in your Ghost Net account for transactions. Get them from
      <a href="https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Connecting to the Application</h2>
  <p>Access the HRM application through the GitHub repository's right-hand side or use this link:
    <a href="https://hrm-chi.vercel.app/" target="_blank">HRM Application</a>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Connect Wallet" on the top-right corner.</li>
    <li>Choose "Temple Wallet" if you have it installed, and connect through the browser extension.</li>
    <li>Your wallet address will be displayed in the navigation bar.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Note: When the application contacts the smart contract, a popup will ask for your wallet password to sign transactions.</p>
  <p>Clicking on the navbar header will return you to the home page.</p>

  <h2>Application Views</h2>
  <p>The application has three main views:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hospital View</strong>: To see the doctor list and hospital list, click on the "Hospital View" tab.
      This will show the list of doctors and their associated hospitals.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient View</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on "Login/Register" on the Patient Tab to access the Patient view.</li>

      <li>To add a diagnosis, click on the "Add Diagnosis" tab and enter the diagnosis details.</li>
      <li>To make an appointment with a doctor, click on the "Make Appointment" tab in the side pane. The appointment is
        visible as a normal diagnosis without any document or diagnosis information. This information will be filled in by
        the doctor.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Doctor View</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Registration is similar to patients.</li>
      <li>For login, doctors only need their Aadhar number.</li>
      <li>To view patients and their diagnoses, and to add them, enter your secret key on the doctor's home page and
        click "Get Patients." This will display a list of patients.</li>
      <li>Click on "Show More" to view all diagnoses for a patient and click "Delete" to remove/revoke access for a
        patient.</li>
      <li>Click on "Edit Diagnosis" for a particular diagnosis to add diagnosis information like documents and diagnosis
        for the patient. This will update that particular diagnosis.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
