Team Name- <h3>Code Crusaders</h3>
Project name - Blockchain-based-Verification-System-for-Product-Authenticity-and-Traceability
Track:- Web3 integration with Web2 Track,NFT & Collectibles
<h2>Project's Description :- </h2>

Our idea revolves around developing a blockchain-based verification system using Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, and a local blockchain network. The system aims to combat counterfeit products and ensure the authenticity and traceability of goods in the consumer market, encompassing both manufactured products and market produce.
