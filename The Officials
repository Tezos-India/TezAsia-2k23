Project Title: Web3 Integration for Reliable Media

Project Objective: Bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2 technologies by integrating Tezos with existing Web2 infrastructure to enable new use cases and applications in the media industry.

Key Challenge: The media industry is facing issues with funding genuine journalism due to the prevalence of superficial content on social media platforms and free content providers. This has led to a decline in in-depth reporting, resulting in the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories that can manipulate public opinion.

Solution Approach: Develop a Web3 protocol that focuses on restoring the media's credibility as a neutral and reliable information source. This could involve creating a system to authenticate information sources and incentivizing accurate data input from various actors in the media value chain.

By integrating Tezos and Web3 technologies with existing Web2 infrastructure, your project aims to promote trustworthy journalism, combat fake news, and protect readers from biased information sources. This approach has the potential to transform the media landscape and promote the dissemination of accurate and credible information.
