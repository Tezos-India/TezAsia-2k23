A FA2-compliant platform for building NFTs on Tezos

## Problem Statement

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art, music, games, to collectibles. They are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. However, creating smart contracts requires technical skills and knowledge of programming languages, such as Michelson for Tezos. This can be a barrier for many users who want to create their own NFTs on Tezos, which is a fast, secure, and energy-efficient blockchain platform.

## Solution

NFTz aims to solve this problem by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the seamless creation of NFT smart contracts on Tezos. The application incorporates the FA2 standard rules, which is a multi-asset interface for Tezos that supports various types of tokens, including NFTs. It offers options to select and include optional specifications while adhering to the FA2 standard. Additionally, the app supports end-to-end creation of metadata for tokens and smart contracts, allowing users to easily host them on IPFS, which is a decentralized storage network. Furthermore, it includes a drag-and-drop block coding feature for custom minting, burning, or other functions. The objective is to create a comprehensive solution that enables users to effortlessly build NFTs on Tezos without the need for coding.
